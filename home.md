# about me 
Hello! I'm Shreyash, a software developer with a passion for building robust and scalable applications. <br/>

With over five years of coding experience, I've specialized in creating optimized full-stack solutions using Next.js and TypeScript. However, my curiosity has led me deep into the world of distributed systems, where I leverage the Go language to engineer complex and interesting projects that tackle challenges of concurrency and resilience. <br/>

Beyond software development, I have a strong interest in data science and machine learning, where I primarily use Python to build applications and continuously explore the latest advancements in generative AI. <br/>

When I'm not coding, I trade my keyboard for a different kind of rhythm, playing percussion instruments like the Tabla and Cajon. I also have a passion for capturing moments through videography and photography. <br/>
